	Dear readers,

	Thanks for reading my second blog. Part of my developer quest was, funny enough, finding out how to write and where to publish my blog. 

	One thing I remembered about GitHub was the fact that it is more than just a code repository. It is also a collaboration platform. So I was wondering whether it was possible to use it for hosting my blogs. This thought turned out to be correct and the solution is called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). 

	The only thing you have to do to get your website (e.g. blog) up and running is to add your static web content to the gh-pages branch of your public repository. In my case [https://github.com/marinusgeuze/developerquest](https://github.com/marinusgeuze/developerquest) the result is directly visible on the gh-pages site [https://marinusgeuze.github.io/developerquest](https://marinusgeuze.github.io/developerquest)

	To make it all fancier I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) which is the engine behind GitHub Pages. The nice thing about Jekyll is that is has an out-of-the-box support for blogs. Furthermore, Jekyll contains a build in development server which allows you to preview your site before you publish it on GitHub Pages. You can use any editor you want this [cheatsheet](http://cheat.jekyll.tips) can help by applying markup.

	When my blog was finally up and running I realized that there was one important capability named “Comments” missing. So after some investigation I found this [blog](http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html) from Ivan Zuzak which I used as inspiration.

	The only thing left on my wish list was a search engine optimization. I used a Jekyll plugin called jekyll-seo-tag for that. [Check this out for more information](https://help.github.com/articles/search-engine-optimization-for-github-pages). Furthermore I submitted the site for inclusion in Google's index.

	The source of this blog solution can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/marinusgeuze/developerquest/tree/gh-pages). There you can find a README.md file which contains a step by step manual.

	**Reminder:** My goal is to learn so feedback, comments and questions about this blog or related code are very welcome.

	Happy coding,
	Marinus
