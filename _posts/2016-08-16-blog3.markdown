Dear readers,

As part of my quest I want to learn more about [Ionic 2](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2). Ionic 2 is a web framework for developing hybrid mobile apps. Ionic is build on top of [Angular 2](https://angular.io) and [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org). With Angular 2 the preferred coding language is [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) which is a typed superset of JavaScript. Currently I only have knowledge of Ionic 1 and Angular 1 so I hope to learn a lot.

In this blog I will explain step by step how to generate a hybrid app with Ionic 2 and how to deploy this app on your mobile device.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). Do not forget to add Node.js to your path variable.
2. Execute this command to install Ionic 2: ```npm install -g ionic@beta```
3. Execute this command to install latest version of Cordova: ```npm install -g cordova```

Now Ionic 2 is installed and you can create your app.

1. Execute command: ```ionic start <appname> sidemenu --v2 --ts```

    *This creates an Ionic 2 (--v2) app using the sidemenu template and TypeScript (--ts) is used as language.*
2. Execute command: ```ionic serve```

    *This starts a live reloading HTTP server which will reload the browser after every code change. :-)*

    *When you use the command ```ionic serve --lab``` it will start an iOS, Android and Windows frame side-by-side.*

3. Execute command: ```ionic platform add android```

    *This adds the native Android platform code to your project. Adding the iOS platform on a Windows PC is not possible, however Ionic has a cloud offering which provides native packaging so that you can create an iOS App without owning a Mac. See this [link](https://ionic.io/cloud#packaging) from more information. Note that Ionic Cloud is still in beta at the moment of writing.*

4. Execute command: ```ionic run android```

    *This creates an Android APK file and installs this on your Android emulator or Android phone when connected to your PC. Use this [tutorial](http://visualgdb.com/KB/usbdebug-manual) to connect your Android device to your PC. Execute command ```adb devices``` to check if your device is properly connected.*

    *The ```--livereload``` allows you to change and test your code on the device without redeploying the app. Sadly it is in beta and it did not work at the moment of writing.*


As you can see it is quite easy to create an empty Ionic 2 app. In my next blog I will add some functionality to my Ionic 2 app using Ionic 2, Angular 2 and TypeScript capabilities so that the Apps gets some body.

**Reminder:** My goal is to learn therefore feedback, comments and questions about this blog or related code are very welcome.

Happy coding,

Marinus
